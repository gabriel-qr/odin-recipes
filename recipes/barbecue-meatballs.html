    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sheet pan-baked BBQ meatballs are bursting with all the goodness of the grill. Smoky and
      tangy, they are perfect on a sub sandwich or just for eating on their own
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef, 20% fat or higher preferred</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons BBQ sauce, or as needed, for basting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ground beef, egg, tortilla chips, ketchup, brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder,
        onion powder, cayenne, oregano, salt, and black pepper to a large bowl. Mix together gently
        with your hands until evenly combined. Roll mixture into balls, about the size of a golf
        ball. Place meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and baste with BBQ sauce.
        Return to the oven and bake about 12 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve as desired.
